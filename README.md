# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** and related marketing performance metrics using Python. The goal is to understand how different acquisition channels contribute to revenue, cost, and long-term value, helping businesses make data-driven decisions on customer acquisition strategies.

## Objective

- Evaluate and compare **customer acquisition cost**, **conversion rate**, **revenue**, **ROI**, and **CLTV** across different marketing channels.
- Identify which channels yield the **highest long-term customer value**.
- Visualize insights using **static (Matplotlib & Seaborn)** charts.
- Build a dashboard-style summary using Seaborn and Matplotlib for quick interpretation.

## Key Visualizations

- Distribution of Acquisition Cost and Revenue
- ROI, Conversion Rate, and CLTV by Channel
- Pie Chart of Total Revenue Contribution by Channel
- Boxplot of CLTV for selected channels (Social Media vs Referral)
- Combined Dashboard Layout using Seaborn + Matplotlib

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data wrangling and computation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – static visualizations and dashboarding

## Metrics Analyzed

- **Acquisition Cost**
- **Revenue**
- **Conversion Rate**
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**
